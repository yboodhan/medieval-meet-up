# Ogr

## About

*** Note: This app is display only and is not designed to be fully functional. It was built for display purposes only.

Ogr was built with a mobile-first approach using React in only two days as part of General Assembly 2020 Hackathon. It was a collaborative project built by myself, two other developers, and a UX Designer. The theme of the competition was "Medieval Meet-Up."

In an effort to stay true to the theme, include Valentine's Day (the final day of our Hackathon), and to have a little fun, we decided to create a twist on the well known dating app, Tinder. Our app, Ogr, takes place in the 16th century in The Kingdom of Far Far Away (the world of Shrek). It is built for the residents of The Kingdom of Far Far Away to find their significant other.

This app was not meant to be a serious app -- instead it was meant to be a parody and was an opportunity for me and my teammates to fill any gaps in our React knowledge, gain collaboration experience, develop our ability to use Github as a collaborative platform as well as gain insight into the process and requirements of making a good user interface (thanks to our UX Designer!).


# React App Details

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
